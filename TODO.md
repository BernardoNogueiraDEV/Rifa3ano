# TODO for Updating Raffle App with 37 Students

## Plan Breakdown:
- [ ] Step 1: Update the 'alunos' array in `app/src/components/secondPage.tsx` to include 37 students, each with 50 numbers (total 1-1850), using provided names and placeholder WhatsApp numbers.
- [ ] Step 2: Update the number input label and placeholder in the form to "1 a 1850".
- [ ] Step 3: Verify the changes by reviewing the file and suggesting a test (e.g., run the app and test form submission).
- [ ] Step 4: Mark as complete and notify user.

Next: Proceed to Step 1.
